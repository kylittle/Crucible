This is the second release version of my ray_tracing 
project! The next release will feature animations and
will be a major departure from the book: 

https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

Here are some things generated in this rendering engine:

First here is the obligatory rendering from the end of the RayTracing book! This project has
come a long way since then:

Next is the first animation! There are some big gaps here for simplicity. For one orbiting rotations
don't exist yet. The camera is walking in a box instead. Also the quality is very low. Partly because I have
destroyed the performance. But also because my laptop is old and weak.

Here is a list of current features:

&emsp;- Path-tracing rendering

&emsp;- Some material and texture support for objects

&emsp;- Multithreading on the CPU

&emsp;- Minimal Obj file support

&emsp;- Spherical skybox mapping

&emsp;- Aliased scene elements for future editing support

&emsp;- Offline animation rendering

Here are some planned features:

&emsp;- Physics driven manipulation of scene elements

&emsp;- GPU edition

&emsp;- Programming language interface with static checking

&emsp;- A pre-vis app to edit scene programs visually before render

&emsp;- And probably a lot more!

TODO: Write a better how to use section here!

Soon some more will be added to describe how the tool works, but since it is changing so rapidly I am going to
let this be for now. There is a good chance this project will need a full on docs page
